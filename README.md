## Inspiration
We were inspired by a seminar talk by Dr. Laurie Rousseau-Nepton about the SIGNALS (Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey) Project at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, where a simulation of star formation was shown.

## What it does
It simulates the formation of a star from small particles in space.

## How we built it
We wrote our own Particle class that simulates the movement of a star, and we built the simulation using PyGame.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our spaghetti code actually works!

## What we learned
We learned a lot about astrophysics, for example, the formation of orbitals, the interaction of bodies in space and eventually the formation of stars. We also explored the Python library named PyGame.

## What's next for Star Formation
The next step would be to make it more realistic by having the particles form masses by orbiting around one another instead of "consuming" each other.
